I used Dr.Weaverâ€™s code base, so you just need to do cradle installDist and go run the
./interaction under the build.

On part two-  

in order to not make the convex null out of view too fast, I put a 0.5* penalty on the drag vector. 

On part Three,  

I use K and L to loop through the name. 

On part Six: 

You can use U for make the balloon big and J for make the balloon smaller. 

Other than that all the other cases are based on description you give us. 

 

On the bonus point I did first 3 bonus: 

The first one is using a gl.glScalef in the updateProjection part, basically just push another matrix on the projection to make the entire view to scale 

The second one is the same idea as the first one, do a gl.glRotation with z-axiS. 

And T will zoom in the view R will zoom out the view, z will rotate the view counter clockwise and shift+Z will rotate the view clockwise. 

//code as below. 

gl.glMatrixMode(GL2.GL_PROJECTION);            // Prepare for matrix xform 

        gl.glLoadIdentity();                        // Set to identity matrix 

        glu.gluOrtho2D(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax);        // 2D translate and scale 

        gl.glScalef(zoom, zoom, zoom); // scale the matrix 

        if(counterclockwise) 

        { 

            gl.glRotatef(rotatex,0.0f,0.0f,1.0f); 

  

        } 

        else 

        { 

            gl.glRotatef(rotatex,0.0f,0.0f,-1.0f); 

        } 

 

On bonus three, when you hit key H, 

All the node in the view will line up in a line on x-axis, what I did is just set the y to be 0 and different of x, will be width1+width2, which width1 is the left object and width2 is the width of the right object.

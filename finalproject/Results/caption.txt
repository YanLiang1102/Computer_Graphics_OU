So I did all the basic stuff and all the bonus questions:

1.the screenshot shows that you can add a star to a random position and also select either of them,
and move them around, 
and delete the select one.
"A": will allow you to add a random star
"D": will allow you to delete the current selected star
"T": not tab will help you to choose a star, for some reason tab is not listened on my system.


2. you can drag the kite around

3. you can make the hopscotch move its position and also when click shift with left and right the step is only 0.1*sidewalk

4.also since when you keyPress is captured the keyClicked is also getting called, in order to distinguish the
  click to change the position of the star, and click to define the tail of the kite
  you need to click
  "K": to let you make click into the drag Kite mode
  "L": click L will make u exit the drag kite mode

5. and when you are in "L" mode when you drag you can change the centroid of all the stars. and also they will always within the view

6. and by clicking page up and down you can change the length of the fence.
